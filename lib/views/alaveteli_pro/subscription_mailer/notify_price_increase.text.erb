Dear <%= @user_name %>,

We're writing to let you know that the cost of your
WhatDoTheyKnow Pro - https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/pro
subscription is rising to <%= @amount %> per <%= @interval %>. You'll see this change
reflected in your next bill.

We hope you continue to see the value in your subscription
https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/profile/subscriptions.

This is the first time we've increased the cost of Pro since we
launched with our introductory pricing in 2017. There are many
features we want to introduce, to make WhatDoTheyKnow an even
more powerful platform for your work, so we invest your <%= @intervally %>
subscription directly into development and maintenance.

People do great things with WhatDoTheyKnow Pro. Here are a few
of the impacts we've seen from our users. We hope these will
inspire you to think of new directions you could go in with Pro
and if you've achieved something amazing through your usage too,
please do let us know about it communications@mysociety.org.
